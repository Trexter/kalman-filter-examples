# kalman-filter-examples
MATLAB example implementations of a Kalman Filter and Extended Kalman Filter.

These example programs require the statistics and machine learning tool box for gaussian visualization.

I wrote these example implementations to teach my robotics team members how to implement a KF/EKF.
